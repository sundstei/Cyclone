High performance message bus interface with low friction.

Uses an actor per subscription to handle communication with the message bus. Two different types of message clients are available for communication. One for highspeed and one for shared use of resources. 

Opinionated approach to message bus communication and removes a lot of the noise of extended options for AMQP messages.
